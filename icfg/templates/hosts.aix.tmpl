## This file (/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl) is only utilized
## if enabled in cloud-config.  Specifically, in order to enable it
## you need to add the following to config:
##    manage_etc_hosts: True
##
## Note, double-hash commented lines will not appear in /etc/hosts
# 
# Your system has configured 'manage_etc_hosts' as True.
# As a result, if you wish for changes to this file to persist
# then you will need to either
# a.) make changes to the master file in /opt/freeware/etc/cloud/templates/hosts.aix.tmpl
# b.) change or remove the value of 'manage_etc_hosts' in
#     /opt/freeware/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or cloud-config from user-data
# 
# The following lines are desirable for IPv4 capable hosts
127.0.0.1 loopback localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
