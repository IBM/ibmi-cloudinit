## The purpose of this script is to allow cloud-init to consume
## rightscale style userdata.  rightscale user data is key-value pairs
## in a url-query-string like format.
##
## for cloud-init support, there will be a key named
## 'CLOUD_INIT_REMOTE_HOOK'.
##
## This cloud-config module will
## - read the blob of data from raw user data, and parse it as key/value
## - for each key that is found, download the content to
##   the local instance/scripts directory and set them executable.
## - the files in that directory will be run by the user-scripts module
##   Therefore, this must run before that.
